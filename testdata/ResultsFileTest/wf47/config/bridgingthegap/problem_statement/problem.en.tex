\illustration{0.44}{bridgingthegap.jpg}{A bridge with low capacity}%
A group of walkers arrives at a river in the night.
They want to cross a bridge, which can hold a limited number of walkers at a time.
The walkers have just one torch, which needs to be used when crossing the bridge.
Each walker takes a certain time to cross; a group crossing together must walk at the slowest walker's pace.
What is the shortest time it takes for all walkers to cross the bridge?

For example, Sample Input 1 assumes the bridge can hold $2$ walkers at a time and there are $4$ walkers with crossing times $1$ minute, $2$ minutes, $5$ minutes and $10$ minutes, respectively.
The shortest time of $17$ minutes can be achieved by the following sequence of crossings.
First, the two fastest walkers cross in $2$ minutes.
Second, the fastest walker crosses back in $1$ minute.
Third, the two slowest walkers cross in $10$ minutes.
Fourth, the second-fastest walker crosses back in $2$ minutes.
Fifth, the two fastest walkers cross in $2$ minutes.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $c$, where $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^4$) is the number of walkers, and $c$ ($2 \leq c \leq 10^4$) is the number of walkers the bridge can hold at a time.

Then follows a line containing $n$ integers $t_1, \ldots, t_n$ ($1 \leq t_i \leq 10^9$ for all $i$).
The $i^{\text{th}}$ walker takes time $t_i$ to cross.

\section*{Output}

Output the minimum total time it takes for the entire group to cross the bridge.
