#
# Purpose:
#   This script installs a Linux service that runs the script to create
#   the cgroup necessary for PC2 sandboxes.  The service is a one-shot service
#   that simply runs the PC2INSTALL_DIR/bin/pc2installsandbox shell script
#   After running this script, there is no need to reboot the system if the script
#   completes successfully.
#
# Arguments:
#   pc2user - Linux login name of the user that will be doing judging or auto-judging
#   pc2group - Linux group name of the user that will be doing judging or auto-judging
#     You can determine the group name of the user 'pc2user' by issuing the following command at
#     the Linux command prompt:
#       id -gn pc2user
#  The pc2user and pc2group are used to set ownership of the cgroup v2 for so the
#  judge can use the sandbox.
