The legal use of PC&sup2; is governed by the [Eclipse Public License v2.0](https://github.com/pc2ccs/pc2v9/blob/develop/LICENSE.TXT).  

Having said the above, it should be noted that PC&sup2; was originally developed, and continues to be developed, by a community of volunteers according to a certain set of community principles and guidelines. One of those principles centers around the concept that _we didn't develop it to make money_, but rather to provide useful tools for people who want to run programming contests.  We have donated it to the open-source community in that same spirit.  As a result, _we would take offense_ if someone were to take our free community project and attempt to make a profit from it.

Note also that the license under which PC&sup2; is distributed requires (Section 3.1a) that _any modifications which are made to the program must be distributed in **source code** form_.  In other words, you can modify it however you like, but if you do then _you must freely distribute your modifications_.
