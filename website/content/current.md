**NOTICE**  This public repository for the PC&sup2; Contest Control System is still _under development_.  You're welcome to look around,
but until an official announcement is made (and this notice is removed), _we do not recommend relying on the code published here_.
If you are interested in obtaining a copy of PC&sup2; for running a contest, please refer to the [PC&sup2; home page](https://pc2.ecs.csus.edu).

<ul>
<li>    <b>Latest stable release</b>: the main public release. This release has been widely used around the world in many contests and is recommended for those who want the assurances of a stable, vetted system for running their contest.</li>
<li>    <b>Release Candidate</b>: an advance look at the proposed next public release of PC&sup2;. This release contains significant new features planned for upcoming public release. This release has been thoroughly tested, but is not yet guaranteed "stable" -- it should work fine but may have as-yet undetected issues. Recommended only for those who would like to test out upcoming new features.</li>
<li>    <b>Nightly Build</b>: the latest developer-generated build of PC&sup2;. These builds should only be used by those interested in tracking the latest goings-on with PC&sup2;. Nightly builds have typically at least been vetted by developers to be "functional", but they may contain significant flaws or incomplete features. Nightly builds are not recommended for use in a live contest (at least, not one whose results you care about).</li>
