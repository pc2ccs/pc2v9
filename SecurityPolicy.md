# Security Issues in PC^2

If you discover an issue in PC^2 that represents a contest security problem (for example, an exploit where a contest team could somehow
gain access to another team's code, or gain access to the judge's solutions), please _**do not file a GitHub "issue"**_ on it.
Doing so could potentially _advertise_ the vulnerability and therefore affect many contests before we can address the problem 
and close the exploit.

Instead, please immediately _**send an email to the PC^2 maintainers**_ at **pc2@ecs.csus.edu**.  Please describe the issue in detail
so that we can immediately investigate and work toward a rapid fix.  Please include information on the environment (Windows, OS/X,
Linux, etc.) in which the vulnerability was found.

If you have a proposed solution to the issue, please give as much
information regarding your solution as possible.  If you are interested in coding and contributing a fix yourself, even better! 
We welcome such contributions, and we'll work with you via email to arrange a "private issue" through which you can contribute your fix.
