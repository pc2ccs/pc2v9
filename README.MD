**NOTICE**  This public repository for the PC&sup2; Contest Control System is still _under development_.  You're welcome to look around, 
but until an official announcement is made (and this is notice removed), _we do not recommend relying on the code published here_.  
If you are interested in obtaining a copy of PC&sup2; for running a contest, please refer to the [PC&sup2; home page](http://pc2.ecs.csus.edu).

PC^ 2 (the **P**rogramming **C**ontest **C**ontrol system, pronounced "P-C-squared" or sometimes just "P-C-Two" for short) is a 
software system designed to support programming contest operations in a variety of computing environments including MS Windows, Mac OS/X,
and virtually any flavor of Unix-like platform. 
PC2 allows contestants (teams) to submit programs over a network to contest judges. 
The judges can recompile the submitted program, execute it, view the source code and/or execution results, 
and send a response back to the team. 
The system also supports an "automated judging" mode where judging is performed by software rather than by human judges.

The system automatically timestamps and archives submitted runs, maintains and displays current contest standings in a variety of ways, 
and allows the judges to retrieve and reexecute archived runs. 
It also provides a mechanism for contestants to submit clarification requests and queries to the judges, 
and for the judges to reply to queries and to issue broadcast bulletins to teams. 

In addition, PC2 supports contests being held simultaneously at multiple sites by automatically transmitting contest standing 
information between sites and generating a single contest-wide standings scoreboard at each remote site.

A wide variety of configurable options allow the contest administrator to tailor the system to specific contest operations. 

PC2 was developed at California State University, Sacramento (CSUS), and is Copyright (C) by the PC2 Development Team: John Clevenger,
Doug Lane, Samir Ashoo, and Troy Boudreau.
