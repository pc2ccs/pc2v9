In order to support executing submissions in a sandbox on Linux, we use cgroups v2.  Therefore,
the systems that are doing judging must support that.  Most newer Linux systems do.

The cgroup used for pc2 judging, /sys/fs/cgroup/pc2. must be created and set up with the proper
permissions every time the system boots (cgroups are not persistent across reboots).  The pc2_cgroup.service
systemd service arranges for this to happen.  It is a "one-shot" service, and all it does is execute
the /usr/pc2/bin/pc2installsandbox shell script.  Right now, it is hardcoded to execute the script in that
location.  We will need a more definitive way for it track down the install script.

To add this service to your system (as root):

1) copy the pc2_cgroup.service file to /etc/systemd/system
2) systemctl enable pc2_cgroup.service
3) systemctl start pc2_cgroup.service (not necessary if you plan on rebooting right away).

To see the completion status of the service:

systemctl status pc2_cgroup.service
